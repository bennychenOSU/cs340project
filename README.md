Project Title: General Goods Inc.,
Step 1: Project Proposal, Outline, ERD

Overview
General Goods Inc., is a newer retailer that is developing a database for business intelligence in the pursuit of growth for their budding business. Being a limited selection general goods store, General Goods Inc. needs this database in order to track its best performing employees, and to analyze which products of theirs sell the best in order to properly stock these items. The corporation consists of 10 stores, 10 employees, and offers a variety of 20 items with annual sales revenue of $15,000,000. It is setting up a database driven website to record data about inventory levels mapping Items to Stores, Sales to Customers, Staffing levels of Employees to Stores, and Customers in order to drive this expansion. This database is to be developed over the course of the next 8 weeks, with progress checks due roughly once a week.

Upgrades to the Draft Version Based on Previous Feedback
Attributes changed to singular to stay consistent with naming schemes
Sales_id now primary key for Sales table
Added NOT NULL to name attributes of Employees and Customers tables
No changes needed for the schema to be 2NF.
Updated Schema diagram, so no lines are covered. 

No further changes were made to the design, as the only criticism received was that the primary key ID names were plural, but no such naming pattern was found on review with all ID tags being singular.
